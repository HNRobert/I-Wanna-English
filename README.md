# [I Wanna English](https://github.com/HNRobert/I-Wanna-English)

  A VSCode Extension that enforces the use of English in the Editing view

## Why?

It's really annoying when you wanna start coding happily, but the Input method suddenly bump out and scare you.

This Plugin would more or less solve the problem: You would switch to English automatically the moment you get into the editing view, isn't it great?

## How to use?

On Installing the Extension, you may go to the settings and find the following settings:

They are similar to these in the Vim Extension -- Yeah, literally the Same...

To get started, you need to install [im-select](https://github.com/daipeihust/im-select) to help the extension switch the language of your system.

After installing it, put the path of the executable in the settings as the following format:

Then click the Enable option, and have fun coding!

(There is a testing function, type ```>I Wanna English: Test``` on the searching column above, and you will see the test function)

PS. You can also replace English with any other language, as long as you like.

Meanwhile, if you want to disable this function for a while, just a click at the status bar, anytime.
