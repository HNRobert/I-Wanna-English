## Why?

It's really annoying when you wanna start coding happily, but the Input method suddenly bumps out and say hello to you.

This plugin would more or less solve the problem: You would switch to English automatically the moment you get into the editing view, isn't it great?

## How to use?

On Installing the Extension, you may go to the settings and find the following items:

To get started, you need to install [im-select](https://github.com/daipeihust/im-select) to help the extension switch the your input method before hitting the keyboard.

They are similar to those in the Vim Extension -- Yeah, literally the same...

After installing it, put the path of the executable in the settings using the following format:

Then click the **Enable** option, and have fun coding!

(There is a testing function, type `>I Wanna English: Test` on the searching column above, and you will see the button)

PS: You can also replace English with any other language, as long as you like (易语言: ? (bushi)).

Meanwhile, if you want to disable this function for a while, you only need to:

- Click the status bar icon
- Use keyboard shortcut:
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Alt+E`
  - macOS: `Cmd+Option+E`
